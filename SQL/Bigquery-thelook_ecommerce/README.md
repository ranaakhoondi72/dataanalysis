# üõçÔ∏è Profit Analysis in an E-Commerce Dataset with BigQuery & Python

## üí° Project Overview

I explored Google BigQuery's public datasets to uncover business insights from real-world data. One of the datasets that caught my attention was from an e-commerce business in the apparel and accessories industry.

The first business question that came to my mind was:  
**"Where does the profit come from?"**  
Which **month** generates the most profit?  
Which **product categories** are the most and least profitable?

To answer these, I used **SQL (with CTEs)** to query the data in BigQuery and **Python (with pandas and matplotlib)** to visualize the results.

## üìä What I Did

- Queried the `thelook_ecommerce` dataset from BigQuery using CTEs
- Calculated monthly revenue and cost by product category
- Computed profit by subtracting total cost from total revenue
- Visualized the results using a **stacked bar chart** in **matplotlib**
- Created a pivot table to organize profit by month and category

Although I usually find **Looker Studio** more intuitive and enjoyable for dashboards, I challenged myself to use `matplotlib` in Python for this post.

## üß† Key Insights

- **May (Month 5)** is the most profitable month overall.
- **Maternity** and **Outerwear** are the most profitable categories.
- **Suit Sets** are the least profitable product category.
- **August (Month 8)** shows the lowest overall profit.

Based on column names and product types, this dataset clearly belongs to a **fashion e-commerce** company.
